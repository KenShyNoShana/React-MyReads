# MyReads Project

This is my version of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project was to create a Book Tracking App, where you can search up books and then "set" them in one of three shelfes.

## TL;DR

To have a look at the project yourself:

- cd into "starter"
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the project on your local machine with `npm start`
